# Introduction

Inspired by https://github.com/nmn/nextjs-app-dir-stylex/blob/1ae35c91819ece812097186942f0a7096ef81ebc/app/layout.tsx#L4

Petersan(named after one of my friends), is a starter template with NextJS 14 App router and StyleX integrated. I would normally use Tailwind for styling, just for the sake of easiness. But I do admit writing CSS is more creative than using class based Tailwind.

### Run local

```
npm install
npm run dev
```
