# Introduction

Petersan(named after one of my friends), is a starter template with NextJS 14 App router and StyleX integrated. I would normally use Tailwind for styling, just for the sake of easiness. But I do admit writing CSS is more creative than using class based Tailwind.

### Run local

```
npm install
npm run dev
```
